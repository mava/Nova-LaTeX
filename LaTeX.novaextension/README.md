This extension provides support for [**LaTeX**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX):

- Syntax highlighting, symbolization, and folding.
- Building and previewing PDF files, with LaTeX ⇌ PDF synchronization.
- Smart code completion, contextual hover information, and issue reports.

## Requirements

- Syntax highlighting, symbolization, and folding work out of the box, for LaTeX (`.tex`) and BibTeX (`.bib`) files.

- To build PDF files from LaTeX sources, [**MacTeX**](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) (or any other TeX distribution with `latexmk`) is required.

- To preview PDF files with LaTeX ⇌ PDF synchronization, the PDF reader [**Skim**](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io) is required.
To enable jumping back to the LaTeX source line in Nova corresponding to a point in a PDF in Skim, open Skim’s **Preferences → Sync** and then choose **Nova** from the **PDF–TeX Sync Preset** dropdown menu.

- Smart code completion, contextual hover information, and issue reports require the [**TexLab Language Server**](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab). The easiest way to install TexLab is to first install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and then run `brew install texlab` in a terminal.
If no language server is installed or the path provided in this extension’s **Preferences** tab is incorrect, then smart code completion, contextual hover information, and issue reports are just not available, but everything else works.
Other LaTeX language servers may also be used.
Make sure that the **Language Server** features are enabled in Nova’s **Preferences → Editor → Extensions** (they are enabled by default).


## Usage

To build and preview PDF files, this extension provides **Build** (⌘B) and **Run** (⌘R) tasks, available in the project toolbar, under the Project menu item, and in the command palette (⇧⌘P).
There is also a **Clean** (⇧⌘K) task to remove TeX auxiliary files.

These tasks become automatically available in any project containing `.tex` files.
The default engine (pdfLaTeX or XeLaTex or LuaLaTeX) used to **Build** (⌘B) PDF files can be chosen in this extension’s **Preferences** tab, and it can also be configured on a per-project basis in **Project → Project Settings**.
By default the tasks use whichever file is active, but there is also an option to choose a main (root) `.tex` file in the **Project Settings**.
Custom LaTeX tasks can also be added&#8239;—&#8239;and used, for example, in **Task Pipelines**.

The **Run** (⌘R) task opens in Skim the PDF corresponding to the LaTeX source in Nova’s active editor, and highlights the line under the cursor’s position in Nova.
By default, Skim is kept in the background, but this can be changed in this extension’s **Preferences** tab.

To jump back to the LaTeX source line corresponding to a point in a PDF file, just ⇧⌘-*click* on a point in the PDF in Skim.
Make sure that **Nova** is selected in Skim’s **PDF–TeX Sync** preferences, as explained above in the third bullet point under Requirements.

The log files produced during the **Build** (⌘B) task are available in Nova’s **Reports Sidebar**.
Compilation errors and warnings are displayed in the **Issues Sidebar** and in the editor gutter (this requires the TexLab Language Server).
Finally, outlines of LaTeX and BibTeX files are shown in the **Symbols Sidebar**, which can be used to navigate the documents.

## Technical Implementation Details & Credits

This extension is elementary.
As the name suggests, it only supports LaTeX (and BibTeX), but no ConTeXt, no plain TeX, etc.
It uses [`latexmk`](https://www.cantab.net/users/johncollins/latexmk/) for its **Build** and **Clean** tasks:

- **Build** calls `latexmk 🔨 -interaction=nonstopmode -synctex=1 -cd 📜`, where `🔨` is either `-pdflatex` or `-xelatex` or `-lualatex` or empty, according to the choice in **Preferences**, and `📜` is the active file or the one chosen in **Project Settings.**
- **Clean** simply calls `latexmk -c -cd 📜`.

This should cover most use cases.
Instead of providing an interface to some of `latexmk`’s many, many configuration options in the extension Preferences, I recommend using `latexmkrc` files.
These can be tracked in revision control systems, shared with collaborators, and used in other apps and operating systems.

The Build, Run, and Clean tasks are automatically available.
Technically, they are implemented [as Task Assistants, and *not only* as Task Templates](https://docs.nova.app/extensions/run-configurations/), because for most use cases “requiring a user to add an instance of a task via a Task Template may be too much overhead[.”](https://docs.nova.app/extensions/run-configurations/#defining-a-task-assistant)
This way it’s also possible to open a single `.tex` file in Nova and just build it, with no need to first choose a project for the corresponding window.
<!-- “You have not yet chosen a project for this window.” -->

The cool stuff (smart code completion, contextual hover information, issue reports) is provided by the [TexLab Language Server](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab).
Nova’s implementation of the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) is great, and TexLab’s implementation of the LSP for LaTeX is great&#8239;—&#8239;why reinvent the wheel?
In fact, this extension uses nothing more than Nova’s Language Server Extension template (and so it can be run with other language servers; for example, [Digestif](https://github.com/astoff/digestif)).

Syntax highlighting, symbolization, and folding are based on the [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) parsers [tree-sitter-latex](https://github.com/latex-lsp/tree-sitter-latex) and [tree-sitter-bibtex](https://github.com/latex-lsp/tree-sitter-bibtex).

LaTeX ⇌ PDF synchronization just works thanks to [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io)’s implementation of the magic of [SyncTeX](https://github.com/jlaurens/synctex).

I cobbled together this extension around my (perhaps idiosyncratic) LaTeX workflow, and I’ve been happily doing all my TeXing in Nova ever since.
Hopefully, other LaTeX users may find this extension useful, too!
